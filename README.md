# Todo List (Redux)

'I've Got To Do This' is a todo list app using Redux. Users can add, edit and delete the todo items and also mark theme as complete. I have also implemented a light and dark mode; originally using context and changing this to Redux.

In the project directory, you can run the below command to get started:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
