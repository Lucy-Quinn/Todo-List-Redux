# I've Got To Do This (Redux)

'I've Got To Do This' is a todo list app using Redux. Users can:

- Add, edit and delete the todo items and mark them as complete. 
- Choose from a list of emojis to add to their todo notes. This list is sorted by categories. The data is loaded from an external API: [emoji-api](https://emoji-api.com/), which I have implemented using Redux-Saga.
- Create, edit and delete todo lists and add their todos to these lists. 
- Toggle between light and dark mode; originally using context and changing this to Redux.
